### Problem: What is the optimal number of patients a provider should see in a day?

For my Insight project, I wanted to work on solving a common problem that we encounter often. During out patient visits, many of us end up waiting for a long time to see the doctor. Ideally, patients should get to spend more time with the doctor in the exam room, which can elevate the overall healthcare experience. 

This leads us to the question of my problem statement. How many patients should providers (doctors) see in a day? This is to make sure patients do not feel rushed, receive adequate time and attentive care from their providers and respond with high rating scores on feedback survey questions.

It may seem intuitive to think that the fewer patients each provider sees a day, the better scores these providers and the healthcare organizations receive. In reality , however, these decisions are not as straightforward as they seem. Healthcare organizations need to maintain healthy cash flow margins to cover huge operating expenses. They need to maintain the right patients per provider ratios to stay in business. More specifically, the question then becomes: what is the optimal ratio that allows healthcare organizations to maintain healthy operational margins and at the same time allow patients to have more time with their providers?

To help answer this question, I partnered with NYC-based startup that collects patient feedback data for urgent care centers.

The first step was to segragate data specific to each organization, extract the features of importance and weed out missing values.
