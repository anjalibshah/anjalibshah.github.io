### Problem: What is the optimal number of patients a provider should see in a day?

For my Insight project, I wanted to work on solving a common problem that we encounter often. During out patient visits, many of us end up waiting for a long time to see the doctor. Ideally, patients should get to spend more time with the doctor in the exam room, which can elevate healthcare experience for patients. 

This leads us to the question of my problem statement. How many patients should providers (doctors) see in a day such that patients do not feel rushed, receive adequate time and attentive care from their providers and respond with high rating scores on feedback survey questions?

To help answer this question, I partnered with NYC-based startup that collects patient feedback data for healthcare organizations.
